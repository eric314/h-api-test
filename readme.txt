Hello,


Follow your preferred method of git cloning this repo to your local machine. It was written and tested on a Macbook Pro but should in theory work fine on Windows or Unix as well.

The only requirement is that you will need to have the latest version of Node/NPM installed.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

To run this Hedgeable API test submission, ensure that the node_modules directory is *not* present.
$ rm -rf /node_modules

Perform a node install of the necessary modules:
$ npm install

Run the stub API and associated tests:
$ npm test


Enjoy,
EM
